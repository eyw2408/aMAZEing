Gamers… Dreamers… Memers… We are a group of college students from UC Berkeley, passionate about game development, who have developed a game about mazes.  All joke aside, we have a little robot named Gerald, that takes an amazing dive through space and time itself. Help him navigate through space as he tries to return to his home planet while avoiding obstacles such as rocks, monsters, and a constantly changing limited line of sight.

We all have backgrounds in music and decided we wanted to make a music based game. One day, when we were trying to come up with game ideas, we browsed through our school meme page and found the shooting star meme. So, the game takes inspirations from Pokemon, Undertale, and of course the "fat man does amazing dive" meme.
Feel free to reach out to us if you have any comments, advice, or better memes.  Hope you enjoy! ^__^
